# ETL-Project

## Project Proposal

Our project will look at the most popular baby names and birthdays for people within the united state for the years between 1994 and 2003. We will gather data looking at the number of children born in each year, by month, day of month, and day of week.  Additionally we will gather information on what boy and girls name were most popular during each year. We will prepare this data for future analysis using ETL methods.
